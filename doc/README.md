# Project Documentation

Below is a list of guides designed to help you get started making contributions to the project as quickly as possible. They are listed in a loose order, first by getting your machine set up, an overview of best practices to use, followed by a high-level overview of how the project is designed. From there it drills down into increasingly more specific topics for reference. This is a living document and should not be treated as a product specification. Major changes may go undocumented for long periods of time. If you find documentation that is out of date or feel that there is missing information, please make edits and submit a pull request.
